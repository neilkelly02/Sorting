# sorting-display
Another one of our summer projects, this is a web based app that displays animations for multiple sorting algorithms, including bubble, insertion, selection, quick, and merge. The algorithms are visualized using bar graphs which are first randomized. The bar graph is updated step by step as the algorithm is run. Finally, we've implemented a wide range of UI options and customizations.
